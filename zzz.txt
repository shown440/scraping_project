User Click:
Clicking the "Refresh Data" button triggers a JavaScript event.

Background Process Start:

The button hides, and a "Processing..." spinner appears.

A request is sent to Django's start_processing URL.

Django launches a background thread to scrape/process CIA data without blocking the user.

Data Processing:

Scrapes the latest CIA data from the OIG website.

Compares new data with the previous pull to detect additions/removals.

Logs changes in the database (DataChange model).

Auto-Refresh on Completion:

JavaScript checks the dashboard every 3 seconds.

When the "Latest Pull" timestamp updates, the page reloads automatically.

The UI displays new changes (added/removed records).

Key Flow:
Click → Hide Button → Start Thread → Scrape → Compare → Save Changes → Detect Update → Reload Page
